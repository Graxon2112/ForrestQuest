# ForrestQuest


+ Forrest Quest is a game alot like choose your own adventure. I made it in c++.This is my first time using File reading and writing, Functions, and Sleep
it will ask you a question with a yes or no anser. For example...


                            You see a lion Do you Run?
                           
                         n
 That "n" Will take you to a diffrent question. If they Wrote A "y" it would take you to another question.
